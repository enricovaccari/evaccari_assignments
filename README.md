## **Introduction**
**MTM (Maya Tool Manager)** is a **Python-based Maya tool** aimed at managing your Maya scripts all at once.
It gives you great flexibility in the creation of shelves/menus and tool organisation/reordering and allows you to cherry-pick the tools you're planning on using in your Maya scene without installing them all and crowding your shelves unnecessarily. 

> Making your Maya workflow efficient is key to professionalism.
